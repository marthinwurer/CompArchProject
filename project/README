I procrastinated too much. That being said, I only figured out my final architechture
the night before my second extension was due. The complex addressing modes killed me
and I coudn't think my way through them.

Opcodes were far more challenging than they should have been. I spent an hour trying to
figure out what was wrong with my cmp before I just gave up. For some reason the ALU subtraction was
not working correctly. I'm really at a loss as to why that was happening.

Backdoors are used in branches because I'm not sure how else to do the math for branches without
killing myself. Speaking of branches, I'm having issues getting my branch values to match yours.
Even looking at the bits of the opcodes, they are not the values in your output files.
